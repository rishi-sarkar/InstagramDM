# InstaDM

InstaDM is an iOS application built with Swift that leverages `WKWebView` to provide a streamlined Instagram experience. The app opens Safari instances of Instagram, injects custom JavaScript to interact with the page's DOM, and restricts scrolling on the main feed, stories, and reelsâ€”ensuring users can focus on viewing shared media without distraction.
